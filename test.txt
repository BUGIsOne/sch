1 I can see by my watch, without taking my hand from the left grip of the 
cycle, that it is eight-thirty in the morning. The wind, even at sixty miles 
an hour, is warm and humid. When it's this hot and muggy at eight-
thirty, I'm wondering what it's going to be like in the afternoon. 
In the wind are pungent odors from the marshes by the road. We are in an 
area of the Central Plains filled with thousands of duck hunting sloughs, 
heading northwest from Minneapolis toward the Dakotas. This highway is 
an old concrete two-laner that hasn't had much traffic since a four-laner 
went in parallel to it several years ago. When we pass a marsh the air 
suddenly becomes cooler. Then, when we are past, it suddenly warms up 
again. 
I'm happy to be riding back into this country. It is a kind of nowhere, 
famous for nothing at all and has an appeal because of just that. Tensions 
disappear along old roads like this. We bump along the beat-up concrete 
between the cattails and stretches of meadow and then more cattails and 
marsh grass. Here and there is a stretch of open water and if you look 
closely you can see wild ducks at the edge of the cattails. And turtles. --
There's a red-winged blackbird. 
I whack Chris's knee and point to it. 
``What!'' he hollers. 
``Blackbird!'' 
He says something I don't hear.``What?'' I holler back. 
He grabs the back of my helmet and hollers up, ``I've seen lots of those, 
Dad!'' 
``Oh!'' I holler back. Then I nod. At age eleven you don't get very impressed 
with red-winged blackbirds.
